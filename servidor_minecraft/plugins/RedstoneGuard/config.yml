# RedstoneGuard Configuration

# Block settings
blocks:
  threshold:
    GLOBAL: 2  # Default threshold for all blocks. Increase for more redstone activity
               # Set to -1 to disable specific component limiting
               # Specific thresholds for different redstone components
               # Higher values = more activations allowed before blocking
    REDSTONE_WIRE: 2      # For redstone dust and clocks
    REDSTONE_TORCH: 4     # For redstone torch circuits
    REDSTONE_BLOCK: 3     # For redstone blocks
    REPEATER: 2           # For repeater circuits
    COMPARATOR: 4         # For comparator circuits
    DISPENSER: 3          # For dispenser machines
    DROPPER: 3            # For dropper systems

# Chunk protection
chunks:
  threshold: 1024  # Maximum redstone activations per chunk
                   # Set to -1 to disable chunk-based limiting
                   # Increase for larger farms or set to -1 if you don't want chunk limits

# Piston settings
max_piston_push: 4  # Maximum blocks a piston can push
                     # Increase this for larger piston-based farms
                     # This affects farms that use pistons to break blocks

# Block period (in milliseconds)
block_period: 2000  # Time before resetting activation counts
                    # Lower = more frequent activations allowed
                    # Higher = more strict limiting
                    # 1000 = 1 second, 3000 = 3 seconds

# Visual effects when blocking redstone
block_effect: SMOKE  # Options: SMOKE, FLAME, SPELL, etc.
block_effect_data: 0

# Cache settings
cache:
  expiry: 30000      # Cache expiry time in milliseconds (default: 30000 = 30 seconds)
  cleanup_interval: 300000  # Cleanup interval in milliseconds (default: 300000 = 5 minutes)
  initial_size: 1000   # Initial size for cache maps
  use_concurrent_maps: true  # Use ConcurrentHashMap for better thread safety

# Block tracking settings
tracking:
  # How blocks are identified in the tracking system
  block_id_format: "%x%/%y%/%z%"  # Format for block IDs
  chunk_id_format: "%x%/%z%"      # Format for chunk IDs

# Effect settings
effects:
  offset:
    x: 0.5  # X offset for effect location (default: 0.5)
    y: 0.0  # Y offset for effect location (default: 0.0)
    z: 0.5  # Z offset for effect location (default: 0.5)

notifications:
  staff:
    enabled: true  # Enable/disable notifications
    permission: "redstoneguard.notifications"  # Permission to receive notifications
    threshold: 20  # Number of blocks before notification
    cooldown: 20   # Time in seconds between notifications for the same chunk
