# LightUpdateOptimizer settings
lightUpdatesOptimizer:
  enabled: false # Set to true to enable light update optimization. Default is disabled.
  async: false # Set to true to run light updates asynchronously. Recommended for better performance.
  interval: 10 # Defines how often (in seconds) light updates are processed.
  chunksPerCycle: 1 # Number of chunks to process per cycle. Lower values may improve server performance.
